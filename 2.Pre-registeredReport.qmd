# Abstract:

The existent diagnostic tools for space sequence synethesia are based on
questionnaire and response consistency. Consistency is calculated as the
area between repetitions for the same inducer. In the first present
phase, available data from 570 participants is used to explore new
geometrical features to discriminate syntheses from controls.
Conceptually, our goal is to take advantage of the inducer's ordinality
that create synesthetic forms. For this aim, we harness a geography
package to extract geometrical features to use as a test for synethesia.
Reciever Operator Characteristics are used to select the features that
best diagnose synesthesia. In a second phase to come, we test the
predictive power of the new diagnostic features onto newly collected
dataset.

# Introduction

**Synesthesia** is the concomitant perception from two different senses,
for example certain humans perceive numbers as having a well defined
position in space. Synesthetes come in all colour and flavours such as
...

Space Sequence Synesthesia (SSS) is a phenomenon present in some humans
who perceive a spatial property for sequentially ordered or organized
stimuli such as time or numbers, as early described by [@galton1880].
The estimated prevalence for SSS in the general population span between
4.4 % [@brang2013] and 14.2 % [@seron1992], see also [@ward2018;
@sagiv2006]. These estimates depend on diagnostic criteria for SSS. A
strict definition of Synesthes requires this five different criteria
[@deroy2013]:

1.  Automaticity: the inducer automatically triggers the concurrent. For
    example February might automatically trigger a specific location in
    the top left peri-space. Analogously to a colour word activates the
    colour in human literates (see stroop effect).

2.  Unidirectionality: the inducer triggers the concurrent but the
    concurrent trigger the inducer. For example if February
    automatically triggers the top left pei-space, the top-left peri
    space does not trigger February.

3.  Consciousness: The experience is conscious. For example a synesthete
    is conscious of his or her perception of February in the top left
    peri-space.

4.  Development: Should be present early in development. For example
    seeing month in particular spatial location already occurred as a
    child.

5.  Consistency: inducer-concurrent pair is stable in time. For example
    February is perceived on the top left, whether the time of the day
    or age. (Altough some changes might occur with aging).

Consistency is the most suited for experimental settings since it can be
tested by repeatedly presenting specific inducers to participants and
collect the responses for their concurrent. If comparatively similar
responses are given for the same inducers, then syneshtesia could be
detected. Those tests have become the golden standart to detect
synesthesia successfully, for example colour-grapheme synesthesia using
colour picker [@rothen2013]. The transposition of this method to SSS
have however not yelded convincing criteria (see Ward, Roten). Instead
of colour picker, SSS are asked to position a set of inducer on their
idiosyncratic concurrent location on the screen. If each inducer is
repeated several times we can then compute the area between the
responses for each inducer (i.e. a triangle if repeated three times).
The sum or grand average of the triangle areas across several inducers
of several conditions (i.e. number, weekdays and months) is then used to
estimate individual consistencies. The smallest the total, the more
consistent individual responses area. Despite yealding to satisfactory
results, it leads to several limits: participant can give a response in
the same position of the screen and obtain excellent consistency scores.

In addition the method might over-diagnose SSS for some conditions
(tpyes of)?. Month contain 12 stimuli, while weekdays 7, hence SSS with
consistent spatial representations for months might have a higher weight
on the final diagnostic criteria than if weekdays are consistent.

In the following we aimed at taking advantage of two property of
synthetic responses: they give rise to a form (i.e. number form, see
Galton) that follows a sequential order (or ordinality
<!--# There is a reference talking about the importance of ordinality in Syn -->).

We harnessed a geographical package \[ADD REF\] to extract geometrical
features from participant responses. For example we can extract polygons
from each conditions and compute the area of these polygons.

# Methods

*Phase I: present analyses*. First, we reproduce the diagnostic criteria
of each respective dataset. Second, we merge the dataset and compare the
diagnostic criteria across datasets using Reciever Operator
Charachteristics (ROC). Third, we compare wheter the featuers lead to
somilar ROC charachteristics across the different sets (i.e. for months,
weeks and numbers). Fourth, we compute new candidate geometrical
features that could be used to diagnose SS. Finally we summarize and
compare all ROC and select the best features that class synesthetes from
control with the merged dataset.

*Phase II: future analyses.* On a future dataset using the same task, we
will compare the predictive power of the selected features using ROC.

## Materials

A the exception of [@rothen2016], the data from [@ward;
@vanpetersen2020a] were collected online. The 29 inducers were: the 12
months of a year, 7 days of the week and 10 numbers (i.e. hindo-arabic
numerals from 0 to 9). [@vanpetersen2020a] Also presented 50 and 100
numerals, which we excluded here. [@ward] data is collected using the
Syntoolkit.

## Procedure

The details for each procedure is described in each respective article
[@rothen2016; @ward; @vanpetersen2020a], here we describe the common
task.

Each participant is presented with one one inducer at a time at the
center of a otherwise white screen. The participant is instructed to
click at the screen position that they visualize them. Inducers order is
randomized and each inducer is repeated three times.

*The order of the stimuli was randomised, but such that no stimulus was
repeated until the previous batch of unique stimuli (N = 29) had been
presented.*

# *Phase I* Methods

compare the results.

Second, we extract features based on the form. (C) We harness a
geography package to compute segment based features (D) We compute
polygon based features. (E) Convex Hull (F) Angles.

-   Each feature is presented with the following structure:

## Triangle area

**Definition**: Calculating consistency Each stimulus is represented by
three xy coordinates - (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) - from the three
repetitions. For each stimulus, the area of the triangle bounded by the
coordinates is calculated as follows:\
$Area = (x1y2 + x2y3 + x3y1 – x1y3 – x2y1 – x3y2) / 2$

```{r, triangleArea_fun}

# Define area calculation function
triangle_area <- function(x, y) {
  if(length(x) != 3 | length(y) != 3) return(NA)
  area <- abs(
    x[1]*y[2] + x[2]*y[3] + x[3]*y[1] -
    x[1]*y[3] - x[2]*y[1] - x[3]*y[2]
  ) / 2
  return(area)
}

# Apply per group
ds <- ds %>%
    group_by(ID, stimulus) %>%
    mutate(triangle_area = triangle_area(x, y))

# Compute on the same on zs:
ds <- ds %>%
    group_by(ID, stimulus) %>%
    mutate(triangle_area_zs = triangle_area(x_zs, y_zs))
```

## Reproduce Rothen et al., 2016.

Here we reproduce [@rothen2016] ROC results:

```{r, ReproRothen2016}
# Note. the other features computed in Rothen 2016 (i.e. triangle perimeter and magimal length have been compared in a separeate file).

## Compute triangle area by ID X stimulus:
ds_Rothen <- ds %>%
  filter(dataSource %in% "Rothen") %>%
  group_by(ID, stimulus) %>%
  mutate(triangle_area = triangle_area(x, y)) %>%
  ungroup()

## Summarize by ID:
ds_rothen_ID <- ds_Rothen %>%
  ungroup() %>% group_by(ID,group) %>%
  summarize(triangle_area_GA_Rothen = mean(triangle_area)) 
 
Out_area <- Comp_ROC(ds_rothen_ID, "group", "triangle_area_GA_Rothen","ID")

## Reproduce Ward, 2020:

<!--# Should I reproduce it?  (1) data & code are avialable online (2) I already excluded 2 ID and adjusted screen size so it won't do the same (3) Permuted z-score will also differ -->

[@ward] combines different individual measures and features to diagnose
synesthesia in comparison to randomly permuted z-score chance level
thresholds:

![](images/clipboard-1140852143.png)

Since we do not have questionnaire for all the data, we will only try to
reproduce the consistency and sd combination.

The mean area is calculated by adding together the area for each
stimulus and dividing by 29. This unit is transformed into a percentage
area taking into account the different pixel resolution of each
participant.Mean area = $Summed Area / Screen Area$, where:
$Screen Area = Xpixels * Ypixels$

```{r}
ds <- ds %>%  
  group_by(ID,repetition) %>%
  mutate(Consistency_prop = ((sum(triangle_area)/29)*100)/Screen_area)

ds_Q <- merge(ds_Q, ds %>% ungroup() %>% group_by(ID) %>% arrange(ID) %>% filter(row_number() == 1) %>% select(Consistency_prop),by = "ID")

# Sanity Check:
# sum(round(ds_Q$Consistency_prop,3) != round(ds_Q$consistency_score,3), na.rm = TRUE)
# NonMatchID <- unique(ds_Q[(round(ds_Q$Consistency_prop,3) != round(ds_Q$consistency_score,3)),]$ID)
# ds_Q %>%
#     filter(ID %in% NonMatchID) %>%
#     select(ID, Consistency_prop, consistency_score)
# Can ignore the difference, all ID related to the scren size adjusdment in the data wrangle
```

```{r}
# Rescale x & y coordinates depending on screen size:
ds$xSc <- ds$x/ds$width
ds$ySc <- ds$y/ds$height

# Compute the SD across all trials (per ID):
ds <- ds %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(ID) %>%
  mutate(SD_ID_xsc = sd(xSc)) %>%
  mutate(SD_ID_ysc = sd(ySc)) 

# Add to ds_Q:
ds_Q <- merge(ds_Q, ds %>% ungroup() %>% group_by(ID) %>% arrange(ID) %>% filter(row_number() == 1) %>% select(ID,SD_ID_xsc,SD_ID_ysc),by = "ID")

# Sanity Check 
# plot(ds_Q$x_sd, ds_Q$SD_ID_xsc)
# plot(ds_Q$y_sd, ds_Q$SD_ID_ysc)
# NonMatchID <- unique(ds_Q$ID[round(ds_Q$x_sd,1) != round(ds_Q$SD_ID_xsc,1)])
# ds_Q %>%
#   filter(ID %in% NonMatchID) %>%
#   select(ID, x_sd, SD_ID_xsc) # OK!

## Reproduce Root 2021

[@root2021] suggested to use random permutations to calculate individual
chance levels of consistency. Individual x and y coordinates (29
(inducers) \*3 (repetitions) = 87) are randomly shuffled across
conditions and inducers and areas are calculated for each 1000
permutations. Hence giving rise to individual distribution for chance
level of consistency. Z-score is then computed to compare the observed
with the permuted consistencies:

$Zscore = \frac{Obs Consistency – mean(Perm Consistency)} {SD(Perm Consistency)}$

```{r, Permuted}
#| eval: false
#| include: false
#| cache: true

### Create a simulated distribution of consistency.  Note that each time this is run it will give a slightly different answer due to the randomisation

IDlist <- unique(ds$ID)

simulated_consistency <- data.frame() 
observed_consistency  <- data.frame() 

# Waiting bar since it is a computationally intensive process 
n <- 1000  # Total iterations
bar_width <- 50
update_points <- round(seq(1, length(IDlist), length.out = 200))

for(ID_n in 1:length(IDlist)) {
  
  if (ID_n %in% update_points || length(IDlist) == n) {
    percent <- ID_n / length(IDlist)
    num_hashes <- round(percent * bar_width)
    bar <- paste0("[", 
                  paste(rep("#", num_hashes), collapse = ""), 
                  paste(rep("-", bar_width - num_hashes), collapse = ""), 
                  "]")
    cat(sprintf("\r%s %3d%%", bar, round(percent * 100)))
    flush.console()

  observed_consistency[ID_n,1] <- unique(ds_ID$ID)
  observed_consistency[ID_n,2] <- unique(ds_ID$Consistency)
  
  ### calculate the x and y standard deviations (no longer used, but calculated by Ward et al. 2018); Note the syntoolkit software calculated population SD (using N) but R will use sample SD (using N-1).  The values returned are very similar.

    ## shuffle the data
    
    shuffled <- ds_ID[sample(nrow(ds_ID)),]
    shuffled$rep2 <- rep(1:29,3)
    
    area = 0
    
    Stim_list <- unique(ds_ID$stimulus)
    
    shuffled <- shuffled %>%
      group_by(rep2) %>%
      mutate(area = triangle_area(x, y))
    
    simulated_consistency[N_shuffle,1] = unique((sum(shuffled$area)/29) * 100 / (shuffled$width * shuffled$height))
    
  }
  
  ## calculate the p-value and z-score of the observed consistency
  observed_consistency[ID_n,5] <- mean(simulated_consistency[,1])
  observed_consistency[ID_n,6] <- sd(simulated_consistency[,1])
  observed_consistency[ID_n,7] <- (observed_consistency[ID_n,2] - observed_consistency[ID_n,5]) /   observed_consistency[ID_n,6]

# *Phase I.* Results: Novel features

## Segment self-intersection

For each category we compute the number of times the path intersects
within each repetition. This can be conceptualized as drawing a segment
between the ordered inducers of each category (i.e. between 0 and 9 for
numbers) and count how many line intersect. Hence the number of segment
is `length(stimuli)-1`, for each participant we sum the number of
self-intersections.

Note: ideally we should shuffle the repetitions.

```{r, selfInter_fun}

# Topological DE-9IM

See: <https://r-spatial.org/book/03-Geometries.html#sec-opgeom> See:
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM>

DE-9IM is a standard for several topological model's features. It is
called by st_relate. It returns a 3 x 3 matrix (DE9IM) for each
relations:

${\displaystyle \operatorname {DE9IM} (a,b)={\begin{bmatrix}\dim(I(a)\cap I(b))&\dim(I(a)\cap B(b))&\dim(I(a)\cap E(b))\\\dim(B(a)\cap I(b))&\dim(B(a)\cap B(b))&\dim(B(a)\cap E(b))\\\dim(E(a)\cap I(b))&\dim(E(a)\cap B(b))&\dim(E(a)\cap E(b))\end{bmatrix}}}$

⁠dim\$ {\displaystyle \dim }\$⁠ is the dimension of the intersection (∩)
of the interior (I), boundary (B), and exterior (E) of geometries a and
b.

Hence it returns a *spatial predicate* wdefined with mas domains:

# Discussion

From the different features we extracted, topological validity across
the repetitions appeared to be the one leading to the largest Area Under
the Curve. The optimal cutoff was exactly 1.5, leading to a sensitivity
() and specificity ().

The optimal criterion ineeds to be informed about the order between
inducers (i.e. to construct the polygons) and interestingly suggests
that synthetic inducer are structurally mapped following topological
rules analogous to geographical space structures. Hence suggesting a
spatial nature for the synthetic forms of space sequence synesthetes.
